TODO
--------------------
- objects don't take more space when they're used again, has implications on design:
	- put link to dataset from db
	- put links to previous db's for a chain of operations
- comparing physiology data
	+ make tabular display
- Make params_tests_profile to use arrays rather than cell arrays
	+ had to remove size member function
	+ may need to modify subsref [if an array is passed, then call built-in function]
	+ then make plot methods operate on arrays and return plot arrays
	- do for rest of profile elements
- update documentation 
	+ update README
	- make first description no longer than one line on all constructors
- Replace older plot methods with plotFigure(plot_abstract(.)) combinations
	- what to do with Interpreter=None stuff?
- high-order methods:
	+ factor analysis
	+ shuffle predicition
	- pca
	- ica
	- clustering (use for finding multiple solutions?)
		- use ANOVA for showing different distributions
		- need this for finding parameter clusters matching phys data?
+ new subclass for custom analysis
	- add plotTestStats function to group things together [?]
- matrix color plot
- Make PDF with code design
	- add class diagram with converter methods
- CVS
  - present CVS, start using it
  - move this repository to djlab account?
- profile:
	+ make a converter method from params_tests_db to get the profile
	+ make the profile constructor simple
	+ put all test results into the results structure
	+ overload the get method to look into the results structure
- add plot-frame and docgen classes
  + allow adjusting location of title in stack plots
  + invar param value should be indicated on plotPages
  + classes should have function that returns plot_abstract
  + @plot_abstract is one x-y plot w/ legends, etc.
  + @plot_stack, places plots on subplots.
  + sortrows in histograms.m
  + histograms should have same axis limits
  + @plot_abstract/superposePlots, superposes plots on same axis, and 
    return a new plot_abstract object
  - allow fontsize change to fit more on a single page [can use export size for that]
- tests_db
	+ print column numbers in display
	+ define all operations as row logical functions
	+ complex subsref for tests_db. 
  - clustering histograms?

+ matrix stack plot
+ new plot & data type for mean and stds of each test and param value
	+ swapRowsPages, then find statsMeanStd
	+ statsMeanStd needs page-capable mean and std funcs
	+ create special plot with vectors and errorbars
	+ do it over all parameters in the profile
	+ then plot a test for all parameters in the same way
	+ use boxplots
+ poster size: 1.75x1.1 m^2, 68"x43"
+ sortrows(tests_db) only sorts one page and applies to all?
	+ invarValues should've been sorted already? [no, only other columns are sorted]
+ add calcSlowInact to @cip_trace
+ add cip_trace_fileset class
+ make abstract profile class to describe the getResults method
+ Make Matlab contents file
+ getResults for @spikes, @trace
+ Make README file
+ make spike checks in cip_trace_profile
+ make specialized directory for brute_aug_04, move cip_trace_profile there
	+ first make a general cip_trace_profile which takes ready-made objs
+ remove conflicting classes from the cen_matlab module
