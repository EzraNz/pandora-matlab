Name:
- MatHHfit? This is also a general purpose ode sover :)
- MatODEfit?
- VCfit? all functions are functions of voltage/time
- pan_fit: As a Pandora module

Before release:
- update integratepar with same numVals changes to integrate
- there is a major bug with param_HH_chan_int_v. Instead, param_I_2tauh_int_v works.
- move voltage_clamp, model_data_vcs into here. otherwise there is no
   fitting! (except param_func/optimize.) [wrong, there is an optimize
   function in param_func] 
- make this a submodule or subtree of pandora?
- put dist in subfolder with easy name so "help name" gives contents.m
- contents.m file
  - add more param_cap_leak* files
- examples/ dir and at least one example
- convert test.m to a tutorial file
- make more tutorials, especially for simulating and fitting
- doc/ dir for content posted at MathWorks File Exchange and INCF
- make base param_func independent of x?
+ clean lint/cruft: @deriv@, fit_example
